# deep-neural-network-classifier 
### Ready to train, configurable, neutral network model


##### Set up your brain :
- initialization: providing a shape of layers, biases are initialized to zeros and weights using available initializers:
    - random normal
    - random uniform
    - he initialization (recommendable for ReLU hidden layers)
    - Xavier initialization
- Plug your data and train unregularized moddel, during training learning curves can be plotted.
- Model can save/load learned params. 
- Use predict method to evaluate examples.
