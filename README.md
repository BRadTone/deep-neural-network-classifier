### Ready to train, configurable, neutral network model


##### Set up your brain :
1. initialization: providing a shape of layers, biases are initialized to zeros and weights using available initializers:
    - random normal
    - random uniform
    - he initialization (recommendable for ReLU hidden layers)
    - Xavier initialization
