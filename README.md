# deep-neural-network-classifier 
### configurable, ready to go, neutral network classifier


#####Set up your brain :
1. initialization: providing a shape of layers, biases are initialized to zeros and weights using available initializers:
    - random normal
    - random uniform
    - he initialization (recommendable for ReLU hidden layers)
    - Xavier initialization
